# Errors

To make it as easy as possible to write documentation in plain Markdown, most UI components are styled using default Markdown elements with few additional CSS classes needed.
About some errors that I know. It might be duplicated. Cause to figure out, I read another blog or stackoverflow.com searching for them.
I will go on adding the post.
